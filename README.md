### Project 1 - Flicks

Flicks shows the latest movies currently playing in theaters. The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

Time spent: 4  hours spent in total

### What I implemented 

- [x] User can scroll through current movies from the Movie Database API
- [x] Layout is optimized with the ViewHolder pattern.
- [x] For each movie displayed, user can see the following details:
- [x] Title, Poster Image, Overview (Portrait mode)
- [x] Title, Backdrop Image, Overview (Landscape mode)
- [x] Display a nice default placeholder graphic for each image during loading.
- [x] Apply rounded corners for the poster or background images using Picasso transformations
- [x] Add a loading image when loading the list of movies from the api
